# AI-Driven Development of Novel Biodegradable Single-Use Plastics for Medical, Pharmaceutical, and Food Packaging Applications

# Abstract

The adverse environmental impacts of single-use plastics underscore an urgent demand for sustainable and biodegradable alternatives, particularly in sectors such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and food packaging. According to a study by Science Advances (Geyer et al., 2017), approximately 79% of the 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic produced globally ends up in landfills or the natural environment, while the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) reports that 300 million tons of plastic are produced annually, significantly contributing to environmental pollution. Key biodegradable polymers, including Polylactic Acid (PLA), Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), and Polycaprolactone (PCL), show potential but face challenges related to achieving optimal degradation rates, mechanical durability, and cost-effectiveness. This study leverages advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, synthetic data, and predictive modeling to systematically refine these materials to meet specific industry standards. Using Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and Polynomial Regression, we achieved predictive accuracy of 55–60 MPa for tensile strengths and elasticity between 180–350%, tailored precisely to accommodate varied application needs. Controlled degradation rates of 12–45% per year were obtained, aligning with environmental standards and regulatory benchmarks. In the generative design process, we applied Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create new material configurations with specific properties optimized for strength, flexibility, and controlled degradation. Our results demonstrate that AI can effectively predict and optimize material properties across multiple variables, enabling the design of biodegradable plastics that meet both industry-specific demands and sustainability criteria. By balancing functionality with ecological sustainability, our AI-driven approach establishes a scalable pathway for eco-friendly and economically feasible production. This work contributes to a circular economy model, which reduces environmental impact across industries reliant on single-use plastic materials while meeting rigorous performance criteria, offering a scalable solution for the future of sustainable packaging and biomedical materials.
